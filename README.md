# NativeJS-tabs
easy tabs on Native JS
To use this tabs you need.
1. To have 2 css clases:
  .hide that hides your content.
  .show that shows your content.
2. To have a container for tabs.
3. To have tabs in your container.
4. To have contant that yout tabs are supposed to show.

How this works?

We have 3 variables:
1. variable for our tabs
2. variable for container
3. variable for content

We have 2 functions.
1. for hiding content
2. for showing content

We have event listener on "click".
If you click on tab, callback function hides all content and then shows content that belongs to tab you clicked
